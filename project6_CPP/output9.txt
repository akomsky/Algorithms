==============================================
There are 8 nodes in the input graph
==============================================
Source node = 5
The shortest paths from the source node 5 are: 

The path from 5 to 1: 1 <-- 8 <-- 5: cost = 9
The path from 5 to 2: 2 <-- 5: cost = 10
The path from 5 to 3: 3 <-- 1 <-- 8 <-- 5: cost = 14
The path from 5 to 4: 4 <-- 7 <-- 8 <-- 5: cost = 9
The path from 5 to 5: 5: cost = 0
The path from 5 to 6: 6 <-- 7 <-- 8 <-- 5: cost = 8
The path from 5 to 7: 7 <-- 8 <-- 5: cost = 5
The path from 5 to 8: 8 <-- 5: cost = 3
