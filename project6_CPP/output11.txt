==============================================
There are 8 nodes in the input graph
==============================================
Source node = 6
The shortest paths from the source node 6 are: 

The path from 6 to 1: 1 <-- 6: cost = 5
The path from 6 to 2: 2 <-- 6: cost = 5
The path from 6 to 3: 3 <-- 1 <-- 6: cost = 10
The path from 6 to 4: 4 <-- 7 <-- 6: cost = 6
The path from 6 to 5: 5 <-- 4 <-- 7 <-- 6: cost = 11
The path from 6 to 6: 6: cost = 0
The path from 6 to 7: 7 <-- 6: cost = 2
The path from 6 to 8: 8 <-- 2 <-- 6: cost = 7
