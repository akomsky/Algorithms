==============================================
There are 8 nodes in the input graph
==============================================
Source node = 8
The shortest paths from the source node 8 are: 

The path from 8 to 1: 1 <-- 8: cost = 6
The path from 8 to 2: 2 <-- 6 <-- 7 <-- 8: cost = 10
The path from 8 to 3: 3 <-- 1 <-- 8: cost = 11
The path from 8 to 4: 4 <-- 7 <-- 8: cost = 6
The path from 8 to 5: 5 <-- 4 <-- 7 <-- 8: cost = 11
The path from 8 to 6: 6 <-- 7 <-- 8: cost = 5
The path from 8 to 7: 7 <-- 8: cost = 2
The path from 8 to 8: 8: cost = 0
